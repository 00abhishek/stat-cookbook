2011-02-18  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fixed a subtle error in the section Probability Theory. The continuity of
      probabilities property now stands by itself. (Daniel Nolan)


2011-01-10  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fix a wrong index in the finite series involving odd natural numbers
      (Daniel Nolan).

    * Unify indices of finite series to start at 1 where the first index
      yields a vacuous term.

    * Add a few basic identities involving binomial coefficients.


2011-01-04  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fix error in the Dirichlet density: the numerator and denominator of the
      Dirichlet density function was flipped. (Rui Li)


2010-12-18  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add a section about basic concepts in spectral analysis of time series.


2010-12-10  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * In the section Maximum Likelihood, the numerator and denominator of the
      asymptotic relative efficiency was flipped. (Jason He)

    * In the section Point Estimation, the MSE did not include the squared
      bias. (Jason He)


2010-12-01  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add a table describing the behavior of the ACF and PACF for causal and
      invertible ARMA models.

    * Remov the discussion about orthogonal functions in the math section.

    * Augment the distribution tables with plots of that visualize the PMFs and
      PDFs of the major distributions.
  
    
2010-11-19  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * New section Sampling Methods, currently includes the boostrap, rejection
      sampling, and importance sampling.

    * More conjugate priors for the univariate Gaussian likelihood when the
      mean is known and when both mean and variance are unknown. 

    * Split distribution table in two tables for discrete and continuous
      distributions.

    * New distribution functions: Multinomial, Dirichlet, Weibull, Multivariate
      Gaussian, Log-normal, Pareto, Chi-square.

    * Fix log-likelihood symbol (replaced with \ell)
  

2010-10-09  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add two conjugate prior tables for discrete and continuous likelihood
      distributions, including both prior and posterior hyperparameters.
