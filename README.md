The [probability and statistics cookbook][stat-cookbook] contains a succinct
representation of various topics in probability theory and statistics. It
provides a comprehensive mathematical reference reduced to its essence, rather
than aiming for elaborate explanations.

Feel encouraged to extend the cookbook by forking it and submitting pull
requests.

Translations
------------

The cookbook aims to be language agnostic and factors out its textual elements
into a separate dictionary. It is thus possible to translate the entire
cookbook without needing to change the core LaTeX source and simply providing a
new dictionary file. Please see the subdirectory
[translations][stat-cookbook-translations] for details.

The current translation setup is heavily geared to Roman languages, as this was
the easiest way to begin with. Feel free to make the necessary changes to the
core source file to relax this constraint.
